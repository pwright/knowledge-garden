# Using the Skupper console

By default, when you create a {skupper-name} site, you also enable the Skupper console.
The Skupper console URL is displayed whenever you check site status using `skupper status`.

sid:: accessing-console 
## Accessing the Skupper console

By default, the Skupper console is available whenever you create a {service-network} router and is protected by credentials available in the `skupper-console-users` secret.

1. Determine the Skupper console URL using the `skupper` CLI, for example:

   ```
   $ skupper status
   Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
   The site console url is:  https://skupper-west.apps-crc.testing
   ```
2. Browse to the Skupper console URL. 
The credential prompt depends on how the site was created using `skupper init`:

   * using the `--console-auth unsecured` option, you are not prompted for credentials.
   * using the `--console-auth openshift` option, you are prompted to enter OpenShift cluster credentials.
   * using the default or `--console-user <user>  --console-password <password>` options, you are prompted to enter those credentials.
3. If you created the site using default settings, that is `skupper init`, a random password is generated for the `admin` user.
To retrieve the password the `admin` user:

   ```
   $ kubectl get secret skupper-console-users -o jsonpath={.data.admin} | base64 -d

   ```

sid:: exploring-console 
## Exploring the Skupper console

The Skupper console provides an overview of the following:

* Services - services that are exposed on the {service-network}, both local and remote.
* Sites - {skupper-name} installations on the current {service-network}.
* Deployments - deployments relating to exposed services.

The Skupper console also provides useful networking information about the {service-network}, for example, traffic levels between sites.

8. Click the **Site** menu.
This page shows:
   * The number of sites in the {service-network}.
   * The services that are exposed on the {service-network}.

# Skupper Documentation

This repo is used to document Skupper using [AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/) markup and [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/).

Each Skupper function is an Antora module as seen at:
[https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-docs/tree/master/modules](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-docs/tree/master/modules)

The layout of files in each Antora module is:

* `/<antora-module>/pages` contains feature specific documentation, eg see `/modules/cli/pages` for CLI documentation.
* `/<antora-module>/assets/images` contains the image files used in the documentation, eg `/modules/console/assets/images`
* `/modules/ROOT/partials/attributes.adoc` contains variable definitions (AsciiDoc attributes) used by all docs.

## Contributing to the documentation

This section explains how to edit and create documentation PRs.
If you only want to make a small update, you might want to just edit the file and make the PR using your standard process.
If you are familiar with Antora, you can use the `preview-playbook.yml` directly.
If you want to preview changes for more complex contributions, follow this procedure.

* A Node LTS release (We recommend https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm for installation)

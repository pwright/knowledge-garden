Because OpenShift Container Platform is a certified Kubernetes distribution, you can use the supported `kubectl` binaries that are included with OpenShift as described in this documentation, or you can use the `oc` binary.

See the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/cli_reference/openshift_cli/usage-oc-kubectl.html) for more information about `oc` and `kubectl`.

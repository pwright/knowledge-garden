# entityTypes.connector.attributes.messageLoggingComponents

A comma separated list that indicates which components of the message should be logged (no spaces allowed between list components). Defaults to 'none' (log nothing). If you want all properties and application properties of the message logged use 'all'. Specific components of the message can be logged by indicating the components via a comma separated list. The components are message-id, user-id, to, subject, reply-to, correlation-id, content-type, content-encoding, absolute-expiry-time, creation-time, group-id, group-sequence, reply-to-group-id, app-properties. The application-data part of the bare message will not be logged. This log message is written to the MESSAGE logging module. In the 'log' entity, set 'module' property to MESSAGE or DEFAULT and 'enable' to trace+ to see this log message

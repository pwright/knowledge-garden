# entityTypes.httpListener.attributes.host

A host name, IPV4 or IPV6 literal, or the empty string. The empty string listens on all local addresses. A host name listens on all addresses associated with the name. An IPV6 literal address (or wildcard '[::]') listens only for IPV6. An IPV4 literal address (or wildcard '0.0.0.0') listens only for IPV4.

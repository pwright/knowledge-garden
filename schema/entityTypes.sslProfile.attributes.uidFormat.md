# entityTypes.sslProfile.attributes.uidFormat

A list of x509 client certificate fields that will be used to build a string that will uniquely identify the client certificate owner. For e.g. a value of 'cou' indicates that the uid will consist of c - common name concatenated with o - organization-company name concatenated with u - organization unit; or a value of 'o2' indicates that the uid will consist of o (organization name) concatenated with 2 (the sha256 fingerprint of the entire certificate) . Allowed values can be any combination of 'c'( ISO3166 two character country code), 's'(state or province), 'l'(Locality; generally - city), 'o'(Organization - Company Name), 'u'(Organization Unit - typically certificate type or brand), 'n'(CommonName - typically a user name for client certificates) and '1'(sha1 certificate fingerprint, as displayed in the fingerprints section when looking at a certificate with say a web browser is the hash of the entire certificate) and 2 (sha256 certificate fingerprint) and 5 (sha512 certificate fingerprint). The user identifier (uid) that is generated based on the uidFormat is a string which has a semi-colon as a separator between the components

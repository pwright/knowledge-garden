- [[Ingress]] revisited
	- Although `skupper init` by default uses an ingress, you don't always need one. 
	  For example, if you don't ever intend to link a site **to** the site you're creating, you can use `skupper init --ingress none`.
	- If your use case is to expose local (bare metal or VM) services to k8s, you don't need an ingress.
	- If you need an ingress, you might encounter  the following:
	  
	  ```
	  $ skupper init
	  Waiting for LoadBalancer IP or hostname...
	  ```
	- You might get an error like:
	  `Error: Failed to get LoadBalancer IP or Hostname for service skupper-router`
	- That means Skupper cannot use the loadbalancer ingress.
	- To fix this issue, you must either deploy a load balancer to your cluster or use one of the other ingress types:
		- nodeport
		- nginx-ingress-v1
		- contour-http-proxy
		- ingress (flat ingress)
	- If you still encounter issues, checkout the github issues, eg [Setting up skupper with NodePort · Issue #806 · skupperproject/skupper](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper/issues/806)
	- One other thing you can do to check your ingress is to deploy an example, maybe from your cloud provider's getting started and use the hostname of the resulting web app to specify the `ingress-host` parameter.

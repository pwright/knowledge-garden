- What does `skupper revoke access` do?
	- After setting up the hello-world example, and setting context to `west`:
	- ```
	  bash-5.1$ skupper status
	  Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is connected to 1 other site. It has 1 exposed service.
	  There are no links configured or active
	  
	  bash-5.1$ skupper revoke-access
	  
	  bash-5.1$ skupper status
	  Skupper is enabled for namespace "west" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has 1 exposed service.
	  ```
	- So, even tho there are no links from `west`, all links (in this case one link from `east`) are removed and exposed skupper services are orphaned.
	- Looking at the skupper status from `east`
	- ```
	  bash-5.1$ skupper status -n east
	  Skupper is enabled for namespace "east" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has 1 exposed service.
	  ```

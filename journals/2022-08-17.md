- ## Naming sites
  
  Each time you `skupper init` you are creating a new site that appears in the Skupper console and provides two way communication for servers and clients running across the service network.
  
  By default, Skupper names your site to match your namespace, perhaps this isn't ideal.
  For example, you might  name  your namespaces `test` in two clusters and create a service network with two sites named `test`.
  
  One approach is to name your sites by their geographic and provider characteristics, for example, `aws-west` or `gke-east`.
  In a small service network, you might name them by other characteristics, for example `public` and `private`.
  The important step is to `skupper network status` before you create and link new sites and decide on a consistent strategy to support understanding of the topology.

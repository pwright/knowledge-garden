- What if I want to isolate Skupper?
	- It's a good idea when evaluating Skupper to keep things separate, but what does that mean?
	- Maybe you want to deploy Skupper in a separate namespace from your workloads?
		- After initialising Skupper in a namespace you can expose services from a  namespace named `east-backend` using the syntax:
		  ```
		  skupper expose service backend.east-backend --port 8080 --address backend
		  ```
		  NOTE: While you can expose deployments from the same same namespace you deployed Skupper, you can only expose services from other namespaces.
	- Maybe you want to ensure the services exposed by Skupper are not available from other namespaces in your cluster?
		- When you `skupper init  --create-network-policy` the services you expose using Skupper are not accessible from other namespaces.

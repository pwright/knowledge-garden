- What ingress was used to deploy skupper?
	- If you come to a site, it's not obvious what ingress is being used, `skupper status` does not report the ingress used.
	- To determine the ingress used, check the `skupper-site` ConfigMap from the appropriate namespace:
	  ```
	  $ kubectl get cm skupper-site -o yaml
	  
	  apiVersion: v1
	  data:
	    console: "true"
	    console-authentication: internal
	    console-password: ""
	    console-user: ""
	    ingress: nodeport
	    ingress-host: 192.168.39.194.nip.io
	    name: default
	    router-console: "false"
	    router-logging: ""
	    router-mode: interior
	    service-controller: "true"
	    service-sync: "true"
	  
	  ```
	- In this case we can see the `nodeport` ingress is used and an `ingress-host` is specified.

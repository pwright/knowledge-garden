- Many docker users prefer the [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) Kubernetes flavor to Minikube. So, how do you run the examples with `kind`, for example, [Hello World](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-hello-world)?
	- Start your kind cluster:
	  `kind create cluster`
	- Your  environment should pick up the context of this new cluster, check by getting pods:
	  `kubectl get pods`
	  This returns:
	  `No resources found in default namespace.`
	- Configure separate console sessions:
		- **Console for west:**
		- ```
		  export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-west
		  ```
		- Check that your environment is correct using `kubectl get pods`
		- If you encounter issues, use the `kind export kubeconfig` to pick up the `kind-kind` cluster context.
		- **Console for east:**
		- ```
		  export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-east
		  ```
		- Check that your environment is correct using `kubectl get pods`
		- If you encounter issues, use the `kind export kubeconfig` to pick up the `kind-kind` cluster context.
	- Install  the metallb [LoadBalancer](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/loadbalancer/), a summary of instructions below:
		- Create resources and wait until everything is running:
		  `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/namespace.yaml`
		  `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.12.1/manifests/metallb.yaml`
		  `kubectl get pods -n metallb-system --watch`
		- Determine IP pool:
		  `docker network inspect -f '{{.IPAM.Config}}' kind`
		- For me, this returned:
		  ```
		  {.IPAM.Config}}' kind
		  [{172.18.0.0/16  172.18.0.1 map[]} {fc00:f853:ccd:e793::/64  fc00:f853:ccd:e793::1 map[]}]
		  ```
		- Create a `metal.yaml` file using an appropriate IP range based on your output, for example:
		  ```yaml
		  apiVersion: v1
		  kind: ConfigMap
		  metadata:
		    namespace: metallb-system
		    name: config
		  data:
		    config: |
		      address-pools:
		      - name: default
		        protocol: layer2
		        addresses:
		        - 172.18.255.200-172.18.255.250
		  
		  ```
		- Apply that to your kind cluster:
		  `kubectl apply -f metal.yaml`
	- You can now perform the steps for [Hello World](https://github.com/skupperproject/skupper-example-hello-world).
	- **TIP:** You can create a running example by:
	  1. Delete the following from `skewer.yaml`:
	  
	  ```yaml
	    - standard: test_the_application
	    - standard: accessing_the_web_console
	    - standard: cleaning_up
	      commands:
	        west:
	          - run: skupper delete
	          - run: kubectl delete service/frontend
	          - run: kubectl delete deployment/frontend
	        east:
	          - run: skupper delete
	          - run: kubectl delete deployment/backend
	  ```
	  2. Run the following command:
	  
	  ```
	  ./plano run-external ~/.kube/config-west ~/.kube/config-east
	  ```
	-
	- **NOTE:** This procedure does not work on macOS or Windows  because docker does not expose the docker network to the host.
